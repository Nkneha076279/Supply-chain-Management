## Project Process
- **Data Cleaning** â€“ Collected, cleaned, and structured sales data for analysi including product SKUs, supplier information, stock levels, shipping details, and cost 
                      records. Cleaned and standardized the dataset (removed nulls, corrected inconsistencies, formatted dates and numerical fields).
- **Data Modeling** â€“ Created relationships between key tables such as Product, Supplier, Orders, and Transportation.
                      Used calculated columns and measures in Power BI to support KPI generation (e.g., Lead Time, Profit Margin, Defect Rate).
- **KPI Development** â€“ Defined business-relevant KPIs including Total Revenue, Product Sold, Stock Levels, Lead Time, and Defect Rates.
                       Built custom DAX measures for accurate performance tracking and dynamic filtering.
- **Dashboard Design & Visualization** â€“ Designed three interactive dashboards (Overview, Product, Supplier) using Power BI.
                      Used bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and donut charts for clear and intuitive visual storytelling.
                      Added filters for SKU and Supplier to enable drilldowns.
- **DAnalysis & Insight Generation** â€“ Analyzed trends in product sales, supplier performance, cost efficiency, and lead times.
                      Identified high-performing SKUs, bottlenecks in supply chain, and cost-saving opportunities.
- **Business Recommendations** â€“ Suggested improvements in supplier selection and transportation modes based on defect and cost patterns.
                      Recommended stock reallocation based on product demand and order volume insights.
